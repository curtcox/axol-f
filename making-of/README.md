# Making "Frog or Axolotl": the whole conversation

The film is made from one conversation between Curt and Claude ([its transcript](../script/conversation.md)). It was
made in another: this one, in which Curt asked Claude to turn the first into a film, and Claude wrote the code that draws,
voices and assembles it. This is that second conversation, from Claude Code's own record of the session, a day at a time.

It has every message Curt typed (115), every reply Claude wrote (1726), Claude's visible reasoning (218 notes), and one
line for each thing Claude did: each command, file edit and page read (6075 in all). It leaves out what those
commands printed, the images, and the notices the app adds for Claude. When Claude's working memory filled up, it was
replaced by a summary; a one-line note marks each place (44 times). Curt's email address and the home folder are
removed. Times are America/Chicago time.

Made by `npm run making-of` (tools/making_of.mjs).

## The helpers

Claude sometimes started a helper: another copy of itself with its own instructions, for one job (say, describing frames
it has never seen, to check that the pictures read without the words).
